# Hello There:
Currently, I am a Computer Science student at Augusta University 🎓

Growing up, I always loved to ask myself "How does this work?" and somehow the answers to those questions fascinated me. My curiosity made me fall in love with the world of Robotics 🤖, Engineering ⚙ and Computing 💻. And by default, I fell more in love with Mathematics and how is used to explain our world through Physics. 🚀 Some may say I am a bit of a nerd, but I think the more nerd you are, the more aware you are about the beutifulbeautiful world we live in. 🗺

I've liked to find ways to solve problems and get hands on into it to find a solution. So, much so that when I was in Highschool, I enlisted myself to become part of the Robotics Team. From there, I just learned that everything was possible with some chips and software. This is what made me choose the career I am in now!
